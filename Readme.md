The goal of this project is to build a common toolkit for building static sites for a variety of domains. Each program is tailored specifically to one domain, such as a blog, documentation site, or others, the programs are named to reflect this, for example `static-docs` or `static-blog`. Focusing the UX on each domain as necessary, making for a smoother experience, but still sharing a common library, making it easy to create your own.

I don't have much time for this project right now, so it only has what I need, but hopefully long-term it'll turn into something real :D.
